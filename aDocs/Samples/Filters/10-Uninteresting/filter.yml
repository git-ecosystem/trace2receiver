# Filter the Trace2 data stream before generating OTLP.  Use a single
# ruleset to filter out "uninteresting" commands and only generate
# data for "interesting" ones.
#
# Since no `nickname_key` or `ruleset_key` is defined, commands
# will inherit the default ruleset.  And we don't need to define
# `git config` values for them.
